Prior to that, it had established a global partnership to showcase effective, on-the-ground initiatives to stop soil degradation and advocate for healthy soils. And in 2017, the FAO released the Global Land Outlook report that outlines further actions that need to be taken to reverse the worrying trends in the state of the world's land resources. To complement the FAO's efforts, many countries, research centers, NGOs, and institutions including the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) and the Centre for Agricultural and Bioscience launched programs to improve and restore soil health. Accompanying these initiatives is the promotion of scientifically proven soil health-building practices including conservation agriculture, mulching, reduced tillage, and cover cropping. Their adoption could prevent, or even reverse, widespread soil degradation. These practices can also help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and build and retain adequate soil organic matter, which is associated with other benefits, such as improvements to plant health and yields; increased soil water retention, which increases the ability of crops to tolerate drought; and expansion of biological diversity within the soil. Diverse biological organisms in turn play critical roles in soil ecosystems, including decomposition, breaking down pollutants, and cycling essential plant nutrients. Continuous support at the country level from both public and private institutions is necessary to make these practices sustainable in the long term. Particularly, governments must put in place legal frameworks to regulate the use of soil resources. Farmers should be educated about and encouraged to adopt these proposed soil health-building practices. Through the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, the American government offers financial and technical support to farmers and agricultural producers to help them implement soil health-building practices. Individual states, too, have backed efforts to keep soils healthy. California, for example, launched the California Healthy Soils Initiative, which involves collaboration among numerous state agencies and departments. Countries in the African continent also are ramping up efforts to support soil health. Ethiopia's Soil Health and Fertility Ethiopian Soil Information System was set up to map the health status of the country's soils. These data are used to inform policies and develop recommendations for Ethiopian farmers about best practices and which fertilizers and seeds to use. In Nigeria, the Agriculture Promotion Policy (2016-2020) outlines strategies to reverse widespread soil degradation. Nonprofit organizations are also stepping up. The Soil Health Institute, based in North Carolina, plays a leading role in supporting fundamental and applied research on soil health-building practices in the U.S. There is still more to be done, especially by African countries, such as Sudan, whose soils are degraded and that are consistently faced with droughts and other climate change-related extreme weather events. These countries should make this issue a priority by further investing in holistic approaches to building healthy soils. Sustained commitment from governments and nonprofit organizations can be accompanied by financial incentives for farmers.", "ground_truth_entities_list": ["Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N.", "FAO","NGOs","Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa", "AGRA", "Centre for Agricultural and Bioscience","USDA","Natural Resources Conservation Service","American","California","California Healthy Soils Initiative","African","Ethiopia","Ethiopian","Nigeria","Agriculture Promotion Policy","The Soil Health Institute","North Carolina","U.S.","Sudan"]},

By far the cheapest option is the new Galaxy S10e, but is it a smarter upgrade than the Galaxy S10 or a false economy? You might be surprised by their differences. Yes, you get a smaller display on Galaxy S10e and it is also flat but curved edges divide opinion and smartphone displays have become so large some will prefer the budget option. Especially since both sport the same bezel-trimming 'punch-hole' displays. Where the Galaxy S10 stands out is its higher resolution display and toughened Gorilla Glass 6 front panel. But not so fast. These phones run lower resolutions by default and the human eye struggles to see a difference above 300ppi anyway. As for the glass, most people put their phones in a protective case. The Galaxy S10 does have a higher screen-to-body ratio (88.3% vs 83.3%) due to its slimmer bezels, but it's a minimal difference I suspect most people can live with. (note: Samsung claims 91% and 93% ratios but doesn't count the punch-hole). As such, the real win for the Galaxy S10 is its in-display Ultrasonic fingerprint reader. It uses acoustic vibrations to create a 3D model of your fingerprint and it's much faster and more secure than any previous reader. It's also undeniably cool. Galaxy S10e owners have to settle for a reader built into its power button. &nbsp; Predictably, the Galaxy S10e is the smaller and lighter phone thanks to its smaller display but it is also notably more compact than the 5.8-inch Galaxy S9 (147.7 x 68.7 x 8.5 mm, 163 g) making for a very portable phone by today's standards. Elsewhere, both new models also retain the best bits of their predecessor: IP68 water resistance, stereo speakers (bottom grill + an amplified earpiece), USB-C, microSD and the headphone jack survives again. Both phones also gain the ability to repurpose their microSD slot as a second sim, which makes them ideal for simultaneous home/work or personal/travel phone numbers. Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue, and Flamingo Pink while the S10e also has Canary Yellow.&nbsp; So the Galaxy S10e misses out on the Galaxy S10's 2x optical zoom, but I don't think this matters greatly. While the ultrawide lens is ideal for panoramas and shooting indoors, in most scenarios the loss of optical zoom can be mitigated by simply walking close to your subject. Meanwhile, the downsides are shared by both phones: they don't appear to have changed their hardware from the Galaxy S9. While it is true that image processing has become the dominant factor in smartphone camera quality, it is still a disappointing development and the Pixel 3 retains its point-and-shoot camera crown. From a hardware perspective, little has changed on the front either. Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10e Front: 10MP, f/1.9, 26mm (wide), Dual Pixel PDAF Here the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10e have identical hardware and a slight resolution bump from the Galaxy S9. That said, they also have a slower (f/1,9) than the Galaxy S9 (f/1.7) which is a strange decision. Where Samsung has stepped up is the introduction of HDR video recording. Like its camera equivalent, this blends different exposures to retain detail in low and bright light simultaneously and the results are superb. Better still, both model models get this. While identical, it's worth noting the improvements the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10e get from their new hardware. Samsung claims 29% and 37% CPU and GPU boosts respectively over the Galaxy S9 while they also run cooler thanks to their die shrink. Where there is a difference is RAM. The Galaxy S10 has a sizeable 8GB, regardless of which option you buy (128/512GB), while storage determines what you get in the Galaxy S10e: 128GB gives you 6GB, 256GB bumps you to 8GB, there is no 512GB model. . Where the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10e do line-up again, however, is connectivity. While Apple gives the iPhone XR, both Samsung's new models have upgraded 4G for enhanced reception and performance (up to a theoretical 2Gbps) as well as the all-new standard which has improved speed and range. 'Wireless PowerShare' features on both models as well. This is a useful new feature which enables Qi-compatible devices to receive charge from your phone when placed against their back. To work you must have a minimum of 30% left in your phone. As for software, both models have Samsung's cleaner and more intuitive 'One UI'. But be warned: suggest Android updates won't arrive any faster. While the Galaxy S10's battery is almost 10% larger than the Galaxy S10e, the real world differences are minor due to its larger screen and higher resolution. Both also represent improvements from the Galaxy S9 (3000 mAh) and Samsung promises almost 24-hours of battery life from a single charge. Both models also have matching 18W wired and 15W wireless charging. This is fine, though faster wired charging has started to appear from rivals (notably OnePlus). Samsung will launch a 5G Galaxy S10 later in the year with 25W wired charging, which rubs this in for Galaxy S10 and S10e buyers. For my money, given its support of microSD, the 128GB Galaxy S10e is the best value option but - conversely - microSD also means the 128GB Galaxy S10 is worth its $50 premium over the 256GB Galaxy S10e. These phones share a lot more in common than you might expect. If you're on a budget, the 128GB Galaxy S10e is the phone to buy. 6GB RAM is more than enough, and it retains almost all the best features of the Galaxy S10 while matching performance. Step up the range, however, and (again thanks to its microSD slot) you're better off buying a 128GB Galaxy S10 for $50 more than a 256GB Galaxy S10e. You'll bag its superb Ultrasonic fingerprint reader, those slimmer bezels and the 2x optical zoom lens. My complaints are both phones fail to improve their cameras as much as I'd like and their punch-hole designs will be polarising. That said, there's no doubt they live up to their 10th-anniversary billing.", "ground_truth_entities_list": ["Galaxy S10e","Galaxy S10", "Samsung", "Ultrasonic", "Galaxy S9","Pixel 3","Apple","Wireless PowerShare","Qi","Android","OnePlus"]},
"3": { "text": "Shin Megami Tensei V fusion is the game's foundation, and you'll need to use the system frequently if you want to survive. Fusion turns your old demons into something new and, ideally, more powerful. However, you'll need to pay more attention to what you're doing here than in previous SMT games thanks to demon affinities and the newly added essence system. Our Shin Megami Tensei V fusion guide walks you through the basics to get you off to a strong start. Fusion unlocks almost as soon as the game begins, though you're limited in what you can do with it until you reach Tokyo Tower in the Netherworld. By that point, you'll have access to enough demons that you should be able to get a few good fusions in, and it's worth experimenting for a bit. SMT V is similar to Pokemon in that even at the same level, demons obtained through fusion are stronger than demons picked up in the wild. The resulting demon might have boosted stats if you fuse during the full moon, but even if not, this system lets you add new skills it might not have learned otherwise. You must be at least the same level as your target fusion, though if you have the Unforgotten Memories Miracle, the experience boost it provides can push the bonding result past your level. Don't waste your Macca on summoning demons from the compendium. Even with discount Miracles, Sophia charges far too much to make it a practical way of getting demons. Just fast travel back to the area where your target demon roams, and negotiate to recruit it again. When to Fuse in SMT V So when do you fuse in SMT V? The answer depends on your playstyle and what's in your stock at a given point. Fusion in SMT V is more situational and less “fuse it or lose it.” For example, even if a demon learns all its skills, it might have an elemental resistance you need to deal with a difficult foe or boss. In that case, it makes more sense to keep it and maybe boost its stats with some incense than it does to fuse something with a pesky weakness. This was particularly common for me in the first Netherworld region and the early part of Shinegawa, where the variety of available bonds were still scant. You'll know it's time to ditch your demons — or at least start trying — when there's a level gap of five or more between them and you. No resistance will make up for the fact that they just won't be useful in combat anymore at that point. You'll recognize Special Fusions if you've played Persona. These mash two or more demons together to create a more powerful being that's usually unavailable through normal bonding event. When do Special Fusions unlock? Special fusions unlock after meeting certain requirements, such as defeating a boss or completing a specific side quest. However, they're often at a much higher level when you unlock them, so it'll take a while before you can actually fuse them. Sophia is less than forthcoming about the numbers next to your skills, and +1 in SMT isn't code for a thumbs up. Your demons' affinities and your own influence how much MP a skill costs, and that's very important. SMT V's more intense fights require plenty of spells and careful MP management. The higher an affinity, the more MP you save. The opposite is also true. If a demon has negative numbers in a given area, MP costs increase. In short, pay attention to affinities in the fusion results screen before starting the ritual. It's often best to wait until you have a more favorable combination so you don't end up wasting time and demons on a fusion that ultimately hampers you in battle. Apotheosis is fairly straightforward and something you should make part of your normal fusion routine. If you're exploring or doing side quests, you'll run across several high-level essences with spells that would normally be off-limits for a while. Obviously, you should use these on your higher-level demons with favorable affinities, though it's also a handy way to teach the Nahobino some extra skills. Only use Aogami essences on demons if you've either already taught the Nahobino its unique skill or don't want it. Nahobino skills such as Holy Water and Sakanagi are too good to waste otherwise. We touched on how essences and affinities work with the Nahobino in our tips guide, but the brief version is that you should use unwanted essences to bolster the Nahobino's weak points before a major fight. For example, the second boss uses dark spells. If you've got a spare Baphomet essence (or anything else with dark resistance), using it gives the boss one less chance of scoring a critical hit and getting an extra turn. Gustave sells essences if there's a specific one you want, but they're ridiculously overpriced. Your demons will randomly give you their essence after leveling up as well. Either way, you shouldn't be short of essences to tinker with.", "ground_truth_entities_list": ["Shin Megami Tensei V","Tokyo Tower","SMT V","Unforgotten Memories Miracle","Macca","Miracles","Sophia","Netherworld","Shinegawa","Special Fusions","Persona","Nahobino","Gustave"]},
